For [my next project](/electronics/2015/10/11/22kW_charger_and_transformer_soft_start.html), I needed to build in sme thermal protection which would cut off the power in case of overheating. The
  way to do that, is to use a thermal (cut off) fuse which is a one time use circuit breaker which disconnects the circuit 
  once it reaches a certain temperature. Once the fuse has blown, it needs to be replaced.  

My local hardware store had a fuse from "Elmwood Sensors" of type "D076-002" in stock, which is a thermal cut off fuse 
which blows at 77Â°C. That is the fuse I am using. 

The challenge with those is however: how to solder a lead on to them without blowing the fuse while soldering? This is how I did that:
