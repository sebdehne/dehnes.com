Iâ€™m an electronics and computer enthusiast who is currently employed at [Systek](http://systek.no) and works for a large mobile operator 
in Norway. At work I satisfy my hunger for developing large-scale, highly available server software for the 
telecom industry using technologies such as Java, Scala, actors, memcached & ElasticSearch. In my spare time, when not 
working or spending time with my lovely family, I design & build electronics.

This is my personal blog on which I will typically post all kinds of things I want to share. Although mostly related 
to computers & electronics, I might also share photographs or other content from time to time.
