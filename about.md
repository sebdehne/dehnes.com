Iâ€™m an electronics and computer enthusiast who is currently employed at [Systek](http://systek.no) and works for the norwegian tax
office. At work I design and build large-scale, highly available software systems and in my spare time, when not working or 
spending time with my lovely family, I design & build electronics projects.

This is my personal blog on which I will typically post all kinds of things that keep me busy in my spare time. 
Although mostly related to software & electronics, I might also share photographs or other content from time to time.
